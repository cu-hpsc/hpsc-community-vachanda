# Community Software Analysis Proposal
## Software: Scikit-Learn

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.
The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See the About us page for a list of core contributors. The package is mainly used by researchers and data-scientists alike to run and build their machine learning or statistical models on their data and run inference tests. It also provides a list of other statistical operations like dimentionality reduction etc.
